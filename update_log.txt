Base code: 
- Generate a signal with a synthetic Doppler shift
- Use FFT to estimate frequency drift
- Plot true frequency drift vs estimate

- Explored the effects of varying window sizes on time vs frequency resolution
- Split script into estimate_doppler() function
- Upgraded code to use parabolic interpolation to increase accuracy
